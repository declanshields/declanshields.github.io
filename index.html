								<p>Hi there, I am Declan, a final year Games Programming student at Staffordshire University. As a hobbyist drummer and guitarist, I love music, and as such, I am currently doing a disseration on Time-Based Audio Effects that are integrated into UE5 using the Metasound plugin.</p>
								<p>During my time at Staffordshire University, I have learned a bit about DirectX11 in our graphics module, as well as pathfinding and decision making in the AI module during second year. As part of my final year, I am undertaking the audio programming module 
									during which I will be dealing with real-time audio generation, processing and mixing.
								</p>
								<p>During my placement year, I worked for d3t as a Programming Intern. During the beginning of this role, I worked alongside a fairly large team on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, on which I am credited. My job was to learn the code base of the project, and to help out with bug fixing. Towards the end of this project
									I worked with a smaller team to implement a new feature to enhance the user experience, and on tweaking an existing feature to get it up to the client's standards.
								</p>
								<p>Throughout the rest of the placement, I worked alongside some great people on a number of different projects, ranging from helping out on an internal project by developing a tool, to spending some time creating a prototype for a client, which allowed me to witness and understand the planning and implementation of a game, and get a feel for the start to end development cycle.
									I learned plenty of things during my placement, and vastly improved my ability to work as part of a team, and be able to adapt to whichever project I was put on.

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>Below are some of the projects I have completed or are currently in progress during my time at University:</p>
								<h3>Audio Programming Dissertation</h3>
								<p>As my final year project, I have decided to research how time based effects are coded in C++ and to see what the math behind them is. As part of this dissertation, I will be researching mulitple effects such as delay, reverb, and echo and implementing them in my own way into UE5.
									The UE5 implementation will be to take advantage of the Metasound so that I do not need to worry about handling the audio itself. It will also allow for drag and drop usage in other projects already using Metasound.
									My aim for this project is to create a good implementation of a few effects, and combine them in a visual way for the user to interact with as a demo. This will consist of effects modules on screen that the user can drag and drop where they wish and connect in any way they like.
									These will then be used to effect notes passed in from an on screen keyboard to allow the user to freely experiment with the effects, and how the order of them changes the sound.

								<h3>Solar System - Graphics Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/FGGC-Solar-System"><img src="images/SolarSystem.JPG" alt="A screenshot from my solar system project."></a></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to learn about the DX11 shader pipeline, and how to load textures from a file. I created a mostly accurate scale model of the solar system. Click the image above to be taken to the repo.</p>
								<h3>Networking Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/Networking"><img src="images/Networking.jpg" alt="A screenshot from my networking project"></a></span>
								<p>During this project, I had to create a client and server in C# that could connect and communicate. Alongside this, I also had to design a UI for the client. Click the image above to be taken to the project repo.</p>
