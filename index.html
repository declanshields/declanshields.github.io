								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/face.jpg" alt="A picture of me" /></span>
								<p>Hi there, I am Declan, a final year Games Programming student at Staffordshire University. As a hobbyist drummer and guitarist, I love music, and as such, I am currently doing a disseration on making time-based effects and the Unreal Engine 5 Metasounds plugin more easily accessible.</p>
								<p>During my time at Staffordshire University, I have learned a bit about DirectX11 in our graphics module, as well as pathfinding and decision making in the AI module during second year. As part of my final year, I am undertaking the audio programming module 
									during which I will be dealing with real-time audio generation, processing and mixing.
								</p>
								<p>During my placement year, I worked for d3t as a Programming Intern. During the beginning of this role, I worked alongside a fairly large team on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, on which I am credited. My job was to learn the code base of the project, and to help out with bug fixing. Towards the end of this project
									I worked with a smaller team to implement a new feature to enhance the user experience, and on tweaking an existing feature to get it up to the client's standards.
								</p>
								<p>Throughout the rest of the placement, I worked alongside some great people on a number of different projects, ranging from helping out on an internal project by developing a tool, to spending some time creating a prototype for a client, which allowed me to witness and understand the planning and implementation of a game, and get a feel for the start to end development cycle.
									I learned plenty of things during my placement, and vastly improved my ability to work as part of a team, and be able to adapt to whichever project I was put on.

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>Below are some of the projects I have completed or are currently in progress during my time at University:</p>

								<h3>Audio Programming Module</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/Audio-Programming-Module"><img src="images/AudioProgramming.JPG" alt="A Screenshot of the audio system"></a></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to create an audio tool or system for the Audio Programming Module. I took inspiration from Final Fantasy XIV and designed a system that fades between tracks 
									when the player moves between trigger boxes. This functionality was implemented using Unreal Engine 5 blueprint nodes, which were places within a Blueprint Function Library.
									This was done so that the system could be as drag and drop as possible, allowing the developer to drag in the correct functions for when the user overlaps with the trigger to switch tracks.
								</p>
								<h3>Cross Platform Engine Development</h3>
								<p>
									This project is a currently ongoing group project in which we are tasked with creating a framework from scratch that can compile to multiple platforms, and to create a tech demo with this framework.
									My task on this project is to design and plan the physics. So far I have created a RigidBody class that handles the 2D movement and collision of polygons by using the Separating Axis Theorem which
									is where if an axis can be found between the two polygons, then they are not colliding. This method was chosen to limit the amount of individual checks needed between every shape of object allowed.
								</p>
								<h3>Optimisation Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/Optimisation-Project/tree/main"><img src="images/Optimisation.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the data from my optimisation project."></a></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to optimise a program that we had been given. I did this by implementing multithreading and quadtrees. Thanks to my optimistations,
									I managed to improve the speed of the program update loop by 23x from 32.62ms to 1.38ms by using a quadtree of depth 3 (or 32 even quadrants) and 16 threads.
									All of the optimistation data can be found in spreadsheets in the GitHub repo.
