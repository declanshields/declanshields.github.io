								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/face.jpg" alt="A picture of me" /></span>
								<p>Hi there, I am Declan, a final year Games Programming student at Staffordshire University. As a hobbyist drummer and guitarist, I love music, and as such, I am currently doing a disseration on making time-based effects and the Unreal Engine 5 Metasounds plugin more easily accessible.</p>
								<p>During my time at Staffordshire University, I have learned a bit about DirectX11 in our graphics module, as well as pathfinding and decision making in the AI module during second year. As part of my final year, I am undertaking the audio programming module 
									during which I will be dealing with real-time audio generation, processing and mixing.
								</p>
								<p>During my placement year, I worked for d3t as a Programming Intern. During the beginning of this role, I worked alongside a fairly large team on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, on which I am credited. My job was to learn the code base of the project, and to help out with bug fixing. Towards the end of this project
									I worked with a smaller team to implement a new feature to enhance the user experience, and on tweaking an existing feature to get it up to the client's standards.
								</p>
								<p>Throughout the rest of the placement, I worked alongside some great people on a number of different projects, ranging from helping out on an internal project by developing a tool, to spending some time creating a prototype for a client, which allowed me to witness and understand the planning and implementation of a game, and get a feel for the start to end development cycle.
									I learned plenty of things during my placement, and vastly improved my ability to work as part of a team, and be able to adapt to whichever project I was put on.

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>Below are some of the projects I have completed or are currently in progress during my time at University:</p>
								<p>Click on the images to be taken to the GitHub repositories.</p>
								<h3>Audio Programming Dissertation</h3>
								<p>As my final year project, I have decided to research how the Buchla Low Pass Gate works, and implement it within C++ and MetaSounds for Unreal Engine 5.
									This gate is a type of filter that affects the timbre and amplitude of the wave being passed in, resulting in a bongo-like sound.
									The end goal of this project is to prove that I understand what filters are and how they work, as well as my understanding of MetaSounds, by recreating this effect.
								</p>
								<h3>Optimisation Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/Optimisation-Project/tree/main"><img src="images/Optimisation.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the data from my optimisation project."></a></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to optimise a program that we had been given. I did this by implementing multithreading and quadtrees. Thanks to my optimistations,
									I managed to improve the speed of the program update loop by 23x from 32.62ms to 1.38ms by using a quadtree of depth 3 (or 32 even quadrants) and 16 threads.
									All of the optimistation data can be found in spreadsheets in the GitHub repo.
								</p>
								<h3>Solar System - Graphics Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/FGGC-Solar-System"><img src="images/SolarSystem.JPG" alt="A screenshot from my solar system project."></a></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to learn about the DX11 shader pipeline, and how to load textures from a file. I created a mostly accurate scale model of the solar system. Click the image above to be taken to the repo.</p>
								<h3>Networking Project</h3>
								<span class="image main"><a href="https://github.com/declanshields/Networking"><img src="images/Networking.jpg" alt="A screenshot from my networking project"></a></span>
								<p>During this project, I had to create a client and server in C# that could connect and communicate. Alongside this, I also had to design a UI for the client. Click the image above to be taken to the project repo.</p>
